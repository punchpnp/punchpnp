I am a second-year Computer Engineering student at Chulalongkorn University. I have gained valuable experience as a Software Engineer Intern at ttb spark academy, where I worked on developing and maintaining software solutions in a real-world environment.

While I initially focused on web development, I am now expanding my interests into Data Science and Data Engineering. I am passionate about using data to solve complex problems and continuously improve my skills in these areas. I am committed to learning both the technical and analytical aspects of data, with the aim of becoming proficient in building data-driven solutions.
